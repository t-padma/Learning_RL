# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
The repository "Learning_RL" will briefly summarize my understanding of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and any useful resources I will encounter while learning. The primary reference to learn RL is CMU's course [10-703: Deep RL (Fall 2022)](https://cmudeeprl.github.io/703website_f22/) along with the textbook "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"(2nd Ed) by Sutton & Barto.
